## 📖 What is bookmark-is-learned?

bookmark-is-learned helps you turn bookmarks into learning moments right away. Instead of just saving links and forgetting them, this app encourages you to learn or decide what to do with the content immediately. It tackles the common problem where people save useful things but never return to study or use them.

The idea is simple: when you bookmark something, you either start learning at once or decide to discard it. This approach keeps your bookmarks meaningful and helps you manage your reading efficiently.
